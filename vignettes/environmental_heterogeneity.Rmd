Heterogeneous blood feeding is a basic feature of malaria transmission (see [Heterogeneous Transmission](heterogeneous_transmission.html)). In `exDE` the term **environmental heterogeneity** is used to describe the distribution of the mean within a homogenous human population stratum. The approach is motivated by a study of heterogeneous exposure by (Cooper L, *et al.*, 2019)^[Cooper L, Kang SY, *et al.* (2019). Pareto rules for malaria super-spreaders and super-spreading. Nat Commun 10, 3939, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11861-y].
