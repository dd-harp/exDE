This is a hybrid model which tracks the mean multiplicity of infection (superinfection) in two compartments. The first, $m1$ is all infections, and the second $m2$ are apparent (patent) infections. Therefore $m2$ is "nested" within $m1$. It is a "hybrid" model in the sense of [NÃ¥sell (1985)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-01609-1).

# Differential Equations

The equations are as follows:

$$
\dot{m_{1}} = h - r_{1}m_{1}
$$
$$
\dot{m_{2}} = h - r_{2}m_{2}
$$
Where $h = b EIR$, is the force of infection. Prevalence can be calculated from these MoI values by:

$$
x_{1} = 1-e^{-m_{1}}
$$
$$
x_{2} = 1-e^{-m_{2}}
$$
The net infectious probability to mosquitoes is therefore given by:

$$
x = c_{2}x_{2} + c_{1}(x_{1}-x_{2})
$$

Where $c_{1}$ is the infectiousness of inapparent infections, and $c_{2}$ is the infectiousness of patent infections.

# Equilibrium solutions

One way to proceed is assume that $m_{2}$ is known, as it models the MoI of patent (observable) infections. Then we have:

$$
h = r_{2}/m_{2}
$$
$$
m_{1} = h/r_{1}
$$
We can use this to calculate the net infectious probability, and then $\kappa = \beta^{\top} \cdot x$, allowing the equilibrium solutions of this model to feed into the other components.

# Example

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(exDE)
library(deSolve)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
```

Here we run a simple example with 3 population strata at equilibrium. We use `exDE::make_parameters_X_hMoI` to
set up parameters. Please note that this only runs the human population component and that most users should read [our fully worked example](ex_534.html) to run a full simulation.

We use the null (constant) model of human demography ($H$ constant for all time). While $H$ does not appear in the equations above, it must be specified as the model of bloodfeeding ($\beta$) relies on $H$ to compute consistent values.

```{r, out.width = "100%"}

  list(dXdt(t, y, pars, EIR))

                    parms = params, method = 'lsoda', EIR = as.vector(EIR))
