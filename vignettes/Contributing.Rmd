Thank you for taking the time to contribute to **exDE** (Extensible Differential Equations for mosquito-borne pathogen modeling). In this document we will explain the following topics:

  1. What is our Git workflow?
  2. How is the R package organized?
  3. If I am making a large addition (e.g. a new human disease model), what should I add to the package?
  4. After making changes locally, how to rebuild the package and run tests?
  5. How to make a good pull request (PR), and how should reviewers review pull requests?
  6. If the GitHub continuous integration (CI) tests fail, how to diagnose the problems and address them?
  7. How to get ready for a version update (for core dev team)?
  8. If I find a bug or something I just can't figure out, how to ask for help?
  
This document is intended to be a complete guide on how to get started developing with **exDE**. As this document is part of the package, if you find something about it incorrect, baffling, or just have a suggestion, please follow the steps for bug/issue reporting to let us know!

## 1. Git workflow {#sec1}

The **exDE** project is hosted on GitHub ([at this repository](https://github.com/dd-harp/exDE)), and we use a Git workflow based loosely on "Gitflow", described in great detail [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). A Git workflow is a way to use the repository in such a way to invite collaboration in an organized way that protects the latest stable version of the software from unintended changes.

Our workflow is designed around branches. The `main`, `dev`, and `gh-pages` branches always exist in the repository. Other branches exist as long as the person(s) working on them need them, and should be deleted after they have been merged into `dev`.

  * `main`: this is the branch that contains the latest version release of **exDE**, and when it is updated the [CRAN version](https://cran.r-project.org/package=exDE) will also be updated. PRs should not be submitted to it except by the core dev team, as updated to `main` will mean we need to update the package on CRAN and do various other housekeeping tasks to accompany a version update (i.e. create an archival [release](https://github.com/dd-harp/exDE/releases) once the update is accepted by CRAN).
  * `dev`: this is the branch that all PRs from collaborators should be made to. The version of the code at `dev` should always be useable (i.e. pass all automated tests), and will contain the latest cutting edge features. Periodically when `dev` has accumulated a sufficient number of new features, a member of the core dev team will make a PR from `dev` into `main`. Because after `main` is updated we will update the CRAN package, these should not be too often, as CRAN themselves request that package maintainers submit updates ["no more than every 1â€“2 months"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html#Submission).
  * `gh-pages`: this branch exists to support our GitHub pages website (the one you are browsing right now). It is updated automatically by our [pkgdown continuous integration workflow](https://github.com/dd-harp/exDE/blob/main/.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml) which rebuilds the website when `main` is pushed to (i.e. when a PR is merged into `main`). `gh-pages` should be considered a "read-only" branch, even for the core dev team.
  * `feat/*`: branches starting with `feat/` should be how collaborators (and core dev) names branches which are updating or including new features, including but not limited to code, documentation, or tests. For example, a branch which improved documentation for this document could be called `feat/UpdateContributing`. After the PR from a `feat/` branch is merged into `dev`, that `feat/` branch should be deleted. PRs should never be made from `feat/` branches into `main`.
  * `bugfix/*`: for small bugfixes (spelling errors, misnamed variables, etc), it may be appropriate to make a `bugfix/` branch. The same rules apply to these as for `feat/` branches.
  
Some of our branches use [GitHub's branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) to enforce these rules. Core dev team members can access these by going to Settings -> Branches. Both `main` and `dev` are protected from deletion. PRs made to `dev` must be reviewed and approved by at least 1 reviewer before they are allowed to be merged.

### Example

Let's say you have a great idea for a new feature, which is a change to improve this document. Here's how you would get started with our Git workflow to get your feature on the road to being merged into the **exDE** software.

Please note, we assume some familiarity with Git commands here. For a reference on the meaning of these commands, please see the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs).

  1. To start to work on **exDE**, you should first clone the repository. In a terminal window, navigate to the directory you want the `exDE` folder to appear in, and then run `git clone git@github.com:dd-harp/exDE.git`, if you use SSH keys, or `git clone https://github.com/dd-harp/exDE.git` to clone with HTTPS. These links can be found if you click the green "Code" button from the [main repository page](https://github.com/dd-harp/exDE).
  2. Once you clone the repository, go inside it with `cd exDE`. Then run `git fetch --all` which retrieves information about all the branches on the remote (the repository on the GitHub website) into your local repository (the one on your computer).
  3. Now you will switch to the `dev` branch by doing `git checkout dev`. You can make sure it's up to date by running `git pull origin dev`.
  4. Let's say you want to call your new feature branch `feat/UpdateContributing`. You can make it and switch to it by running `git checkout -b feat/UpdateContributing`.
  5. To push this new branch to the remote repository, run `git push origin feat/UpdateContributing`. It will now appear in the [list of branches](https://github.com/dd-harp/exDE/branches).
  6. Now, make your changes! We recommend editing the package in [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) using the R project file `exDE.Rproj` in the repository. This will be explained more in Section [3](#sec3).
  7. Once you are ready to push your changes, use `git add` to either add files to a commit one by one, or if you know you want to add all new and/or modified files, you can use `git add .`.
  8. Run `git commit -m "your message explaining what these changes do"` to make a commit with a message. We do not mind many small commits, so if that is your Git style, please do not feel pressure to only make large commits.
  9. Now `git push origin feat/UpdateContributing` to push the commit to the remote branch `feat/UpdateContributing`! If you navigate to that branch on the GitHub repository, you should see your changes.
  
Now repeat steps 6 to 9 until you are ready to start testing your changes and submit a pull request (covered in Sections [4](#sec4) and [5](#sec5)).

## 2. The **exDE** R package {#sec2}

**exDE** is an R package, so if you are going to be making substantial changes, it is necessary to have a sense of how it is organized and how the package must be rebuilt for creating documentation, exporting functions, and testing. The most extensive documentation for how an R package is structured comes from the official R manual, [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html). A shorter guide with tips on current best practice is the book [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/), if you are unfamiliar with R packages, we reccomend briefly skimming the book as a starting point.

The building of **exDE** is supported by [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/index.html), which is responsible for automatically building the documentation website you are browsing right now, and [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) which is used to test the package.

Some files in the top level directory that are important to be aware of are:

  * `_pkgdown.yml`: this controls how the website is generated, and is explained in [this article](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown.html). If you add or delete functions or objects with documentation to the package, or add or delete vignettes, you must modify this file for the website to build properly.
  * `DESCRIPTION`: this file provides critical information about the package, and documentation for it is at the [official manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file) and the [R packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/metadata.html). It should be updated only for version releases, to include additional authors, or to add additional packages to `Imports` or `Suggests`.
  * `NAMESPACE`: a *read-only* file produced when running [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) to build documentation for the package, it tells R what functions are exported by this package into a user's R session when the load **exDE** with `library(exDE)`. It should never be modified by hand.
  * `NEWS.md`: the NEWS page on the package's [CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/package=exDE) as well as the News tab on the [GitHub pages website](https://dd-harp.github.io/exDE/) are built from this file; it should only be modified by the dev team when ready to update `main` with a new version. For more information, see the `utils::news` help file.
  * `README.md`: this is the main readme file which is displayed on the GitHub repository, the main page of the [GitHub pages website](https://dd-harp.github.io/exDE/), and the README page on the package's [CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/package=exDE).
  
The rest of the package is organized in directories. For more detail, we recommend reading the guides linked to earlier.

  * `.github/`: files that control [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) used to automatically test the package when a PR is made, automatically build the package website, and automatically check code coverage (% of code checked in tests). Much more detail will be given in Section [6](#sec6).
  * `docs/`: this contains the pkgdown website which is built and pushed to `gh-pages` automatically by a GitHub Action. If you trigger a manual (local) build of the website to test something using `pkgdown::build_site`, it will build in this folder. This folder should be considered "read-only".
  * `inst/`: this folder serves many purposes for general R packages (see resources above for details), but currently contains the `CITATION` file used to generate the citation found in `utils::citation`.
  * `man/`: this folder contains the package function/object documentation automatically generated by [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/), and should be considered "read-only".
  * `R/`: the source code of the package lives here; we will describe below the naming convention of the files so you can quickly identify where existing code is, or how to organize and name new code.
  * `tests/`: within this folder is a sub-directory `testthat/` which contains all the automated tests included in the package. Most of them test that models initialized at equilibrium remain at equilibrium after being integrated for some time.
  * `vignettes/`: this folder contains .Rmd files contains the vignettes of the R package, longer form articles that document specific functionality in **exDE**. They are available on the [GitHub pages website](https://dd-harp.github.io/exDE/) via the top drop down menus and the package's [CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/package=exDE).

### `R/` folder

Each model component will have a "base" file ending in `-interface` that defines the generic interface which any model for that component must implement. For example `human-interface.R` defines the generic methods any human disease model must implement and `human-SIS.R` defines specific methods for the SIS model of human disease dynamics.

  * **Adult mosquito component**: base file `adult-interface.R`
    - `adult-GeRM.R`: the generalized Ross-Macdonald model of adult mosquito dynamics.
  * **Aquatic mosquito component**: base file `aquatic-interface.R`
    - `aquatic-basic.R`: the basic competition model of aquatic mosquito dynamics.
    - `aquatic-trace.R`: the trace (exogenously forced) model of aquatic mosquito dynamics.
  * **Human disease component**: base file `human-interface.R`
    - `human-SIS.R`: the SIS model of human disease dynamics.
    - `human-SIP.R`: the SIP model of human disease dynamics.
    - `human-hMoI.R`: the hybrid MoI model of human disease dynamics.
  * **Exogenous forcing component**: base file `exogeneous-interface.R`
    - `exogenous-null`: null (no) exogenous forcing.
  * **Vector control component**: base file `vc-interface.R`
    - `vc-null.R`: null (no) vector control.
    - `vc-lemenach.R`: the Le Menach model of ITN based adult vector control.
  * `diffeqn.R`: the **exDE** generalized differential equations which implement the framework; these should not typically be modified.
  * `metrics.R`: spatial metrics (as defined in the [Spatial Dynamics paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.07.22282044v1))
  * `utils.R`: utility functions

## 3. Making large changes or additions to **exDE** {#sec3}

After reading Section [2](#sec2) you should have a reasonable grasp of how **exDE** as an R package is organized, but to really understand how to implement new models, more detail is necessary on what files one should actually modify or add. We will also describe best practices on what contributors should add to the package when making a large change.

Let's say someone wanted to add a new human disease model, say an SIR model. The basic steps are below:

  1. Within `R/`, make a new file `human-SIR.R` and implement all generic methods from `human-interface.R` for your new model. Also make a function named something like `make_parameters_human_SIR` that will modify the parameter environment to implement the SIR model. You can check the other human disease models as reference.
  2. In RStudio, run Build -> Document (control/command + shift + D) to run roxygen2 which builds functions documentation and updates the `NAMESPACE` with your new functions. Then run Build -> Install Package (control/command + shift + B) to re-install and load the package. This only works if you have opened the `exDE.Rproj` file in RStudio as a project.
  3. Make a new vignette named something like "human_vignette.Rmd" in `vignettes/` describing the model and its parameters, and perhaps a simple simulation of it.
  4. Make a test named something like `test-human-sir.R` in `tests/testthat/` which tests the SIR model behaves as expected under conditions where the outcome is known (e.g. when no infected persons are present, the number of susceptible persons can never decrease).
  5. If you added new functions and vignettes, add them to the `_pkgdown.yml` file in the appropriate place. You can use `pkgdown::build_site` at this point to test that the website still builds.
  6. We will go over more details about how to test your package locally in Section [4](#sec4) and how to make a pull request in Section [5](#sec5).

When writing a new model or modifying an existing one, please note that **exDE** achieves modularity through the extensive use of S3 dispatch, which is similar to single dispatch from other programming languages. More details are at `base::UseMethod` or the [S3 chapter](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html) of Advanced R. Use of S3 dispatch appears extensively in the source code of **exDE**.

If writing new functions, they must be documented. Again, the existing code provides a good reference. **exDE** depends upon [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/index.html) to build documentation, and its website provides help on how to write the appropriate tags (e.g. `#' @export` which makes that function appear in the **exDE** `NAMESPACE`).

### How to make a PR

At this point, you might be a little tired of reading, and maybe somewhat anxious about actually contributing at all. So it is a good time to say that making a PR can absolutely be a collaborative process. If after following the previous sections your local tests are not working, but you think your idea or new feature ought to work and would be a good addition to **exDE**, please consider submitting a PR and tagging other persons on the dev team who can help you get it past the finish line.

To make a pull request, first, navigate to your branch where you have made changes (i.e. a `feat/*` or `bugfix/*` branch). To open the PR, follow the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request#creating-a-pull-request), and remember that PRs should only be made into `dev` (e.g. with `dev` as the "base").

When making the PR, you will be prompted to enter a description which explains what the PR does. Please make sure the text description contains the following elements:

  * If the PR addresses or solves an active issue, tag it in the PR (i.e. if it addresses issue 75, type in the text box `#75` and GitHub will automatically link the two).
  * If the PR adds new files in `R/`, `tests/testthat`, or `vignettes` please list them and write a brief description about what is in each one. This does not apply to any auto-generated files (i.e. anything in `docs/`, `man/`, or `NAMESPACE`).
  * If the PR significantly modifies any files, please list them and write brief descriptions about what was changed. This does not apply to any auto-generated files (i.e. anything in `docs/`, `man/`, or `NAMESPACE`).
  * If this is an in-progress PR (i.e. tests do not pass), please tag someone on the team for help and describe what specific problems you are encountering.
  * Finally, this is crucial, select someone to review your PR using the "Reviewers" tab in the upper right hand corner of the page. Your PR cannot be merged into `dev` until it has passed review by at least one team member.

## Issues

If you find a bug, have a question about how to use a feature that does not have sufficient documentation, or have a suggestion for improvement, please [leave an issue](https://github.com/dd-harp/exDE/issues) at our GitHub repo.

For bug reports please include:

 * **exDE** version
 * Operating System
 * R version
 * Steps to recreate
 * Expected behaviour
 * Actual behaviour

## Git

We use Git on this project. Which means we use `main`, `dev`, `feat/*`, `bug/*`, and `hotfix/*` branches. Please refer to [this post](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for more information of each type of branch. 

  * `main`: this branch always stores the last "production" release of the software, and is a protected branch. A pull request should
  not be submitted to `main` unless it is from `dev`, meaning that the software version should be updated.
  * `dev`: all pull requests from users should be made to the `dev` branch. This branch is protected from deletion.
  * `feat`: new and significantly enhanced features are made in `feat` branches before being merged with `dev`. After a `feat/*` branch is merged
  with `dev`, it can be deleted.
  * `bug`: these branches fix bugs, usually after being raised as an issue. After a `bug/*` branch is merged with `dev`, it can be deleted.
  * `hotfix`: the difference between a `bug/*` and `hotfix/*` branch is `hotfix` is for small quick fixes (misspellings, incorrect arguments, etc.)
  and are short-lived. After being merged with `dev`, they can be deleted.

We periodically merge `dev` into `main` for release updates. These releases will appear on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/dd-harp/exDE/releases). 

## Continuous integration

We use GitHub Actions as our continuous integration platform to run workflows.
The workflows we use are from [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions)
for R packages.

We run three types of workflows.

[R CMD check](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/master/examples/check-standard.yaml)
runs during any pull request to `[main, dev]` branches.

[Test coverage](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/master/examples/test-coverage.yaml)
runs during pushes to `[main]` and uses our [codecov.io integration](https://app.codecov.io/gh/dd-harp/MicroMoB)
for checking test coverage.

Finally, [pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/master/examples/pkgdown.yaml)
runs during pushes to `[main]`.

Please note that sometimes hard to diagnose bugs can be due to out of date
workflows. If you find a strange or unusual bug coming from a workflow, this
is something to consider checking.

## Pull Requests

If making a pull request, please only use `dev` as the base branch. If you are adding a new feature (i.e. the pull is from a `feat/*` branch),
please ensure you have added minimal tests using testthat so that the functionality of your feature can be tested.
