Heterogeneous blood feeding is a basic feature of malaria transmission (see [Heterogeneous Transmission](heterogeneous_transmission.html). In `exDE,` the term **heterogeneous biting** is used to describe departures from the ideal assumption of *mass-action,* a topic explored by Perkins TA, *et al.* (2013)^[Perkins TA, Scott TW, Le Menach A, Smith DL (2013). Heterogeneity, mixing, and the spatial scales of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission. PLoS Comput Biol 9: e1003327, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003540].
. Other departures from being *well-mixed* fall under the category of *heterogeneous mixing.* Computation of the mixing matrix, $\beta$, is described in detail by Wu SL, *et al.*, (2023)^[Wu SL, Henry JM, Citron DT, *et al.* (2023).
