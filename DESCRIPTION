Description: Provides tools to set up modular ordinary and delay differential equation
  models for mosquito-borne pathogens, focusing on malaria. Modular design is achieved
  by S3 dispatch on parameter lists for each component which is used to compute
  the full set of differential equations which may be solved using
  any of the packages for numerical simulation of differential equations in R. The
  methods implemented by this package are described in Wu et al. (2022) <https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.07.22282044>.
